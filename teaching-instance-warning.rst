.. note::
   The teaching instance of the repository is a mirror of the main
   repository site found at `<https://teaching.physiomeproject.org/>`_,
   running the latest development version of :term:`PMR2`. User 
   accounts are periodicly synchronised from the main repository, but
   if you recently created an account on the main site you might need to
   also create a new account on the teaching instance.

   Any changes you make to the contents of the teaching instance are not
   permanent, and will be overwritten with the contents of the main
   repository whenever the teaching instance is upgraded to a new
   release of PMR2. For this reason, you can feel free to experiment
   and make mistakes when pushing to the teaching instance. Please
   subscribe to the `cellml-discussion
   <http://lists.cellml.org/mailman/listinfo>`_ mailing list to receive
   notifications of when the teaching instance will be refreshed.

   See the section :ref:`migrating-from-teaching-to-live-repo` for
   instructions on how to migrate any content from the teaching instance
   to the main (permanent) Auckland Physiome Repository.
