Auckland Physiome Repository - an introduction
==============================================

The Auckland Physiome Repository, includes the CellML and FieldML
repositories, and is powered by software called PMR2.  PMR2 relies on
the distributed version control system `Mercurial`_ (Hg), which allows
the repository to maintain a complete history of all changes made to
every file contained within repository :term:`workspaces`.  In order to
use the Physiome Model Repository, you will need to obtain a Mercurial
client for your operating system, and become familiar with the basic
functions of Mercurial.  There are many excellent resources available on
the internet, such as `Mercurial, the definitive guide`_.  Mercurial
clients may be downloaded from the `Mercurial website`_, which also
provides documentation on Mercurial usage. A graphical alternative to a
command-line client is available for Windows, called `TortoiseHg`_.
This provides a Windows explorer integrated system for working with
Mercurial repositories.
