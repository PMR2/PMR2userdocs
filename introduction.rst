Auckland Physiome Repository - an introduction
==============================================

The Auckland Physiome Repository is the combination of what previously
was the CellML Model Repository and the FieldML repository, and is powered
by a suite of software packages that collectively is known as PMR2.
This repository relies on the distributed version control
system `Git`_, which allows the repository to maintain a complete
history of all changes made to every file contained within repository
:term:`workspaces`.  In order to use the Physiome Model Repository, you
will need to obtain a Git client for your operating system, and become
familiar with the basic functions of Git.  There are many excellent
resources available on the internet and `linked on the Git website`_.  A
notable one is the `Git Beginner's Guide for Dummies`_ as it has
detailed guides on `installation procedures`_ for the major operating
systems and the overall guide is quite excellent.

Previously, the DVCS of choice was `Mercurial`_, but all workspaces
have been converted to using Git as the backend.
